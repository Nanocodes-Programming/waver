BTC Back Above $28K After surging by over $8,000 within a week amid the global banking crisis, bitcoin had calmed around $28,000 earlier this week and remained there for a few days straight. Yet, the asset was destined to go through some more volatile trading hours and days mid-week when the US Federal Reserve was scheduled to announce changes in its interest rate policy. While the expectations varied, the nation\u2019s central bank actually hiked the key rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, prompting more price fluctuations for BTC. The asset reacted with an immediate $2,000 price drop to under $27,000 before it shot back up by a grand. The past 24 hours brought some more gains as bitcoin spiked to just shy of $29,000. Despite getting rejected there, the cryptocurrency still stands with some minor daily gains and trades above $28,000. Alicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?

An eight-count indictment against Kwon was made public in the US District Court in Manhattan, several hours after news of his arrest earlier Thursday in Montenegro. Lawyers for Kwon in the United States did not immediately respond to requests for comment after business hours. Thursday\u2019s indictment charges Kwon, a South Korean national who co-founded Terraform Labs and developed the TerraUSD and Luna currencies, with two counts each of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and conspiracy. The criminal case follows related US Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges against Kwon and Terraform last month. Kwon had been a fugitive for several months, and South Korean authorities issued an arrest warrant for him last September. South Korean police said on Friday that the identity of the suspect arrested in Montenegro had been confirmed as Kwon after his fingerprints matched the information held by the country\u2019s National Police Agency (KNPA). \u201cThis has been shared with the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors\u2019 Office and Interpol in Montenegro,\u201d one official at the KNPA said. Prosecutors will work with other institutions to carry out a swift repatriation, a spokesperson for the country\u2019s prosecution service said. Montenegro\u2019s interior ministry said police detained a person thought to be Kwon and a second suspect, who were trying to board a flight to Dubai at Podgorica airport. Police found forged passports of Costa Rica and Belgium during the encounter, the ministry said. \u201cThe person is suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean national Do Kwon, a co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Terraform Labs,\u201d Interior Minister Filip Adzic wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe former cryptocurrency king who is behind losses of over $40 billion, has been apprehended at the Podgorica airport with forged documents,\u201d Adzic added. TerraUSD was a so-called \u201cstablecoin\u201d designed to maintain a constant $1 price, while Luna\u2019s value fluctuated. But authorities have said TerraUSD and Luna were paired, such that a decline in one could take down the other. They also said Kwon misrepresented the stability of TerraUSD, once among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market value. Both currencies crashed last May, with TerraUSD\u2019s price sinking to less than one penny. In its civil case, the SEC accused Kwon and Terraform of \u201corchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud. \u201cWe also allege that they committed fraud by repeating false and misleading statements to build trust before causing devastating losses for investors,\u201d SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement at the time.",pubDate:"2023-03-24 09:30:50",image_url:null,source_id:"cyprus_mail",category:["top"],country:["cyprus"],language:"english"},{title:"Celebrities Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul charged for touting crypto",link:"https://www.nation.com.pk/24-Mar-2023/celebrities-lindsay-lohan-jake-paul-charged-for-touting-crypto",keywords:["Lifestyle & Entertainment, Newspaper"],creator:["Agencies"],video_url:null,description:"NEW YORK - Actress Lindsay Lohan, YouTuber Jake Paul and six other celebrities were charged by the US Securities and Exchange Com\xadmission for touting cryptocurrencies on social media without disclosing that they were paid to do so.",content:"NEW YORK - Actress Lindsay Lohan, YouTuber Jake Paul and six other celebrities were charged by the US Securities and Exchange Com\xadmission for touting cryptocurrencies on social media without disclosing that they were paid to do so.

Old Friends The executives in question, Xioayun \u201cLily\u201d Zhang and Duncan Rheingans-Yoo, were known to Sam Bankman-Fried from his stint as an employee of Jane Street, and later left to create their own investment firm. However, two notable things have been discovered about the firm by The New York Times. First of all, Xioayun \u201cLily\u201d Zhang appears to have been romantically involved with SBF, according to unnamed sources allegedly familiar with the matter. Bankman-Fried\u2019s girlfriend? Xiaoyun \u201cLily\u201d Zhang, used to be romantically involved with Bankman-Fried, according to four people familiar with their relationship. her partner, Duncan Rheingans-Yoo, had only graduated from Harvard two years before SBF\u2019s investment. That\u2019s textbook \u2014 9:29 (@GuitarSunCat) January 25, 2023 Second of all, it appears that Modulo Capital may have been nearly entirely funded by the FTX Group. According to the same report by NYT, Modulo began trading in cryptocurrency prior to FTX\u2019s collapse, and has now, for all intents and purposes, ceased operations. ADVERTISEMENT Two Rounds of Seed Capital Although the FTX Group\u2019s crypto investment checkbook is a mess that the new CEO is still trying to untangle, FTX VC investment records are far clearer due to reporting requirements. According to the Financial Times, the FTX Group made two separate investments with Modulo Capital, initially pledging $150 million, which was swiftly followed up by another $250 million. The current clawback request , however, aims for the figure of $475 million. Furthermore, court documents suggest that, assuming the deal is approved by the judge presiding over FTX\u2019s bankruptcy case, paying back this sum would almost completely wipe out any capital Modulo has. \u201cThe Debtors\u2019 entry into the Agreement is in the best interests of their estates, creditors and stakeholders, and should be swiftly consummated. The Agreement\u2019s terms will provide the Debtors\u2019 estates significant value representing 99% of the Modulo Entities\u2019 remaining assets and 97% of the original transfers from the Alameda Debtors to the Modulo Entities (after considering expenses and trading losses).\u201d This statement lends credence to the aforementioned theory that Modulo Capital was almost completely financed by the FTX Group. Modulo\u2019s leadership has allegedly agreed to the terms of the clawback, which would spare both sides from having to deal with legal expenses. In return, the FTX Group would renounce all claims to Modulo Capital shares. FTX currently owes its creditors over $11 billion dollars. If the deal is approved, funds returned from Modulo would cover about 7% of the shortfall. Future clawback requests are likely to follow, as the FTX Group has already tried to pursue similar action against Voyager and has announced its intention to go after donations made to political candidates.

Kwon, whose full name is Kwon Do-hyung, has been accused of fraud over his company\'s dramatic collapse last year, which wiped out about $40 billion of investors\' money and shook global crypto markets. The 31-year-old was arrested at the Podgorica airport in Montenegro on a South Korean warrant, the country\'s interior ministry said Thursday. Soon after, the United States charged him with eight counts, including securities fraud and wire fraud, which followed a lawsuit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In South Korea, where Kwon is wanted for violations of the country\'s capital markets act, authorities confirmed Friday that they would seek his extradition. "South Korean prosecutors will take steps to repatriate Kwon Do-hyung. We are working on the process," Kim Hee-kyung, a spokeswoman for the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors\' Office, told AFP. Kwon reportedly flew from South Korea to Singapore ahead of the company\'s crash in May last year. In September, South Korean prosecutors requested that Interpol place him on the red notice list across the agency\'s 195 member nations, and also revoked his passport. But questions about his whereabouts intensified after the Singapore Police Force said that he was not in the country. Montenegro authorities said Thursday that Kwon had "used falsified travel documents from Costa Rica" during passport control for a flight to Dubai. Inspection of their luggage also found travel documents from Belgium and South Korea, while Interpol checks discovered that Belgian documents were forged, Montenegro\'s interior ministry added. Many investors lost their life savings when Kwon\'s Luna and Terra entered a death spiral, and South Korean authorities have opened multiple criminal probes into the crash. South Korea\'s National Police Agency said it would collaborate with the country\'s prosecutors as they seek Kwon\'s extradition. "As an organization that works closely with the Interpol, we will actively cooperate with the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors\' Office," Jeong Beom-seok, an official from the National Police Agency, told AFP. South Korea is a member of the European Convention on Extradition, a multilateral convention that facilitates extradition between member nations, and Montenegro is also a signatory, the justice ministry said in a statement. "The justice ministry will proceed with the extradition process in accordance with laws and international agreements," it added. Cryptocurrencies have come under increasing scrutiny from regulators across the globe following a string of recent controversies, including the high-profile collapse of the exchange FTX. Kwon is accused of "orchestrating a multi-billion-dollar crypto asset securities fraud", according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "It is true that Kwon has done too much damage to too many people, with something that carried a lot of unexplained risks," Cho Dong-keun, an economics professor emeritus at Myongji University, told AFP. "It\'s very unfortunate that he ran away. A responsible adult and entrepreneur would have stayed and explained. The fact that he tried to avoid authorities by even using forged passports shows his character." His TerraUSD was marketed as a "stablecoin", which is typically pegged to stable assets such as the U.S. dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. But TerraUSD was an "algorithmic stablecoin" -- not backed by assets, instead pegged only to its floating sister currency Luna. And some $40 billion in market value was erased when the two currencies went into freefall in May 2022. Kwon and Terraform Labs also moved more than 10,000 bitcoin out of their failed project and converted some of the tokens into cash via a Swiss bank, Bloomberg News reported, citing the U.S. SEC. "Kwon certainly needs to be held accountable for his actions," Kim Dae-jong, a professor of business administration at Sejong University, told AFP. "The bottom line is that Kwon didn\'t run the company according to laws and principles. He exploited it for his own personal, financial gain."',pubDate:"2023-03-24 07:24:31",image_url:null,source_id:"japantoday",category:["top"],country:["japan"],language:"english"},{title:"Linus Tech Tips YouTube Hacked by Crypto Scammers, Channel Deleted",link:"https://hypebeast.com/2023/3/linus-tech-tips-youtube-crypto-scammers-hack-channel-deleted-info",keywords:["Tech"],creator:null,video_url:null,description:"Amidst a market full of shills, the world of cryptocurrency has seen a recent uptick in crypto scams as the concept of decentralized digital currency still remains new to many.

James Lanigan, who previously served as the firm\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, will replace him. The new boss will aim to raise funds from new investors (other than DCG) and prepare Luno for eventual public listing. Marcus Swanepoel \u2013 a South African former banker who founded Luno ten years ago \u2013 praised his successor, believing he could help the platform achieve its primary goals: \u201cThe opportunity for crypto is bigger and brighter than ever, and James is a seasoned operator and an outstanding leader with a track record of success across all aspects of running a truly global fintech business.\u201d The new CEO will aim to guide Luno\u2019s global expansion, increase its market share, and work on a possible public listing.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission on March 22 announced charges against Chinese blockchain personality and billionaire Sun Yuchen \u2014 better known as Justin Sun \u2014 and three of his wholly-owned companies: Tron Foundation Limited, BitTorrent Foundation Ltd., and Rainberry Inc., a firm formerly known as BitTorrent. The complaint alleges that Sun and his companies \u201cfraudulently\u201d manipulated the secondary market for Tron ( TRX ) tokens through \u201cextensive wash trading,\u201d conducting more than 600,000 such trades, and also paid celebrities to promote TRX and BitTorrent (BTT) tokens with zero disclosure. Multiple prominent American celebrities, including Lindsay Lohan and Jake Paul, were named as defendants for their alleged roles in promoting TRX and BTT without proper disclosure. Some have since settled with the SEC. In addition, the SEC alleges that bounty programs and airdrops used to promote TRX and BTT were unregistered investments. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the SEC, commented: Justin Sun is an active figure in the crypto industry who rose to prominence via the $70 million initial coin offering of Tron in 2017. The ICO was reportedly conducted one day prior to the Chinese government\u2019s announcement of a blanket ban on all ICOs within the country. Sun, who reportedly left Beijing shortly after to move to San Francisco, used his newfound wealth from the successful ICO to acquire the peer-to-peer downloading platform BitTorrent. Sun reportedly laid low while in the U.S. and presented himself as an honest businessman fleeing from the specter of communism. U.S. authorities have heard this sort of rhetoric before, however. On March 15, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it had arrested Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui over his alleged role in an alleged $1 billion stock and crypto fraud scheme. Just days before his arrest, Guo shilled to his viewers the importance of his crypto exchange, blockchain technology and tokens he had created in the fight against communism. The interest from U.S. authorities may have been behind Sun\u2019s decision to move out of the U.S. in 2020 and into the sunny Caribbean island of Grenada. He has since become the country\u2019s ambassador to the World Trade Organization. Aside from foreign relations duties and the bestowment of the fancy title \u201cHis Excellency,\u201d the role grants Sun a diplomatic passport that theoretically provides immunity against prosecution. Despite the controversies, Sun appears to be doing quite well in his new home. Last November, Sun reportedly acquired 100% of the co-founders\u2019 stakes in cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global even though he publicly claims he is just a humble \u201cadviser\u201d in Huobi\u2019s everyday affairs. In January, Asia Express reported that many Huobi employees\u2019 benefits were allegedly axed via direct orders from Sun. In other areas, cryptocurrency exchange Binance has also significantly limited its utilization of Tron Tether (TRC-20 USDT) after regulatory backlash on its own stablecoin Binance USD. If Do Kwon has anything in common with James Bond in the 2006 hit film Casino Royale , it is that both found (or are currently finding) their stay in the beautiful seaside nation of Montenegro to be deeply unpleasant. On March 23, Filip Adzic, minister of the interior of Montenegro, announced that a South Korean national suspected of being the wanted fugitive Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon had been arrested at Podgorica Airport over falsified documents. Shortly after the announcement, South Korean authorities confirmed that the detained individual is, in fact, Do Kwon based on a positive match of name, birth date, nationality and photographic evidence. Police say they are awaiting a fingerprint check from Montenegrin authorities to definitively identify the arrested individual. Do Kwon is currently wanted by Interpol, as well as South Korean, Singaporean and U.S. authorities, for his role in the collapse of the $40 billion Terra Luna ecosystem in May. Last October, South Korean prosecutors revoked Kwon\u2019s passport. He was reportedly hiding in Serbia at the time. Serbia shares borders with Montenegro, a Balkan country that became independent in 2006 and, as a result, has signed few extradition agreements with other nations. However, an extradition agreement merely facilitates the process and is not a requirement for extradition to take place. Interestingly, South Korea does not have an embassy in Montenegro and vice versa. Kwon had not been seen since late 2022 until news of his reported arrest. If anything, the blockchain executive has proven to be somewhat of a lackluster gambler. Aside from what appears to be a failed attempt to evade arrest and attempts to double down on the Terra Luna (LUNC) ecosystem, Kwon recently, and finally, lost an $11 million bet that the price of LUNC will be above $90 per token by mid-March 2023. LUNC\u2019s price was $0.0001259 at the time of publication. On a happier note, South Korean gaming giant Nexon announced on March 22 that it had selected Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Polygon ( MATIC ) to power the blockchain ecosystem for the multiplayer 2D fantasy role-playing game MapleStory. According to Nexon, a Polygon supernet created by Polygon Labs will be deployed within Maplestory to allow players to earn and collect in-game items as nonfungible tokens. Ryan Wyatt, president of Polygon Labs, said: Last January, Wyatt announced his resignation as head of gaming at YouTube and joined Polygon Studios as its new CEO. Created in 2003, MapleStory has immense popularity in the Asia-Pacific region and has surpassed 180 million registered players. In-game items are currently purchased using Nexon\u2019s currency, NX. The company reported $2.6 billion in revenue in 2022 and has developed over 50 games since its inception.",pubDate:"2023-03-23 22:50:18",image_url:"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/magazine-Asia-Express-Jan-20-scaled.jpeg",source_id:"cointelegraph",category:["business"],country:["united states of america"],language:"english"},{title:"Coinbase moves to on-chain staking for Tezos, Cosmos, Solana, and Cardano",link:"https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-moves-to-on-chain-staking-for-tezos-cosmos-solana-and-cardano/",keywords:["Exchanges","Regulation","Staking"],creator:["Mike Dalton"],video_url:null,description:"Coinbase has begun its transition to on-chain staking for four cryptocurrency assets, according to an announcement on March 23. The post Coinbase moves to on-chain staking for Tezos, Cosmos, Solana, and Cardano appeared first on CryptoSlate.",content:"Share Tweet Post Share Post Email Ad Coinbase has begun its transition to on-chain staking for four cryptocurrency assets, according to an announcement on March 23 . Four assets affected, one discontinued Coinbase\u2019s announcement and an attached help page say that customers will \u201cearn rewards from the protocol, not Coinbase\u201d under the new approach. Th firm says that its only role will be to connect customers to validators on the relevant blockchain. Coinbase will pause staking and unstaking beginning on March 24 and will resume those capabilities on March 29. Users will continue to earn funds during that time. The policy applies to four of the five assets that can be staked through Coinbase: Tezos (XTZ), Cosmos (ATOM), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). The policy does not apply to Ethereum (ETH) staking, which is also supported by Coinbase. This is likely due to the fact that Ethereum does not yet support stake withdrawals and has high technical and deposit requirements for on-chain staking. Coinbase also said that Algorand (ALGO) staking will be discontinued on March 29. The company will nevertheless pay out remaining ALGO staking rewards to users and will continue to support ALGO trading on its main exchange. Did regulations lead to the change? It is unclear whether the actions are related to the Wells notice that Coinbase has received from securities regulators. Statements from Coinbase today suggest that the changes were scheduled as early as March 10 \u2014 prior to its receipt of that notice. It is possible that the changes were influenced by Coinbase\u2019s February warning that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to take action against retail staking products. The SEC later took action against Kraken , which may have motivated Coinbase to introduce a staking service in which it only plays a minimal role. Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden said that Coinbase told her that it is reexamining its services following regulatory scrutiny. Warden was seemingly unaware of Coinbase\u2019s Wells Notice until a commenter in that Twitter thread informed her of the development. Elsewhere, Coinbase said in a statement to Cointelegraph that it halted Algorand staking for customer experience reasons. It has not commented on reasons for the other changes.

Bitcoin\u2019s price has held the $27,000 support well, indicating intense buying pressure at that level. However, according to a recent post by the trader and analyst Rekt Capital on Twitter, the price is struggling to break through the higher high trendline resistance, as seen in the chart below, preventing it from reaching new highs. The analyst suggests that breaking through the $28,500 price point would be a critical bullish trigger, indicating a solid buying momentum by the bulls and potentially paving the way for further price increases. If Bitcoin were to lose the $27,000 support level, it would signal a bearish trend. Nevertheless, Bitcoin was able to bounce back before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcement, recovering from the $26,600 level. This recovery should be a significant support level for any future decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price, along with the $25,200 floor. Furthermore, suppose Bitcoin continues to struggle to make new highs. In that case, it could be a sign that the market needs a pullback to gather strength before moving higher, like the pullback and further short squeeze that happened in February, falling from the $25,000 resistance. A dip in Bitcoin\u2019s price could be a healthy development for the most significant crypto in the industry, as it would allow the market to reset and potentially create a stronger foundation for the next leg up. What Is The Potential Retracement For BTC In The Event Of A Pullback? According to a recent blog post by analyst Justin Bennet, Bitcoin has already tested the macro resistance level during Wednesday\u2019s FOMC volatility period, which is placed at $28,900. Bennet suggests that \u201cliquidation clusters,\u201d which refer to a concentration of investors forced to sell their positions due to margin calls or liquidation events, can often serve as a magnet for Bitcoin. According to Bennet, more long liquidations are below current levels than short liquidations above $29,000. This suggests that there may be more selling pressure in the market, which could lead to further price decreases. In a downtrend scenario for the most prominent cryptocurrency in the market, the $25,200 will serve as a critical trench for bulls, along with the 200-day moving average, if they want to keep control of the current trend in the market. On the other hand, Bitcoin has held well in the $26,000 zone, which can serve as a minor pullback to retest the macro resistance level and reach the $30,000 milestone. Despite its recent dip in price, Bitcoin has seen a 17% increase in value so far in March, having rallied from its monthly low of under $19,800 on March 10. Year-to-date, Bitcoin\u2019s value has increased by 66%, noting the importance that the cryptocurrency has recorded in the past months amid the financial banking crisis.

Lohan, Akon, recording artists Ne-Yo, and Lil Yachty, boxer and internet personality Jake Paul, and adult film performer Michele Mason all agreed to pay more than $400,000 combined in disgorgement, interest and penalties to settle the claims, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday. None admitted or denied the SEC\u2019s findings as part of the settlement. Two other celebrities named in the SEC's complaint, rapper Soulja Boy and pop singer Austin Mahone, did not reach a settlement with the SEC, the agency said. In response to a request for comment, Lohan's publicist Leslie Sloane said the actress was contacted in March 2022, was unaware of the disclosure requirement, and agreed to pay a fine to resolve the matter. Lohan, who last week announced she is pregnant, was called to give up the $10,000 she was paid, plus interest, and pay a $30,000 fine, according an SEC complaint. A spokeswoman for Paul declined to comment. Emails left with representatives for the other celebrities named in the SEC complaint weren\u2019t immediately returned Wednesday. In the complaint filed by the SEC in federal court in New York, the agency claims the celebrities were paid to promote Tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT), both crypto asset securities that were offered for sale by three companies owned by Justin Sun, a Chinese national. Sun is the permanent representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization and may be living in Singapore or Hong Kong, according to the complaint. Starting at around August 2017, Sun allegedly offered to sell billions in the unregistered securities and engaged in manipulative trading, while also creating secondary markets on which Tronix and BitTorrent could be traded, according to the complaint. \u201cAlthough the celebrities were paid to promote TRX and BTT, their touts on social media did not disclose that they had been paid or the amounts of their payments,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cThus, the public was misled into believing that these celebrities had unbiased interest in TRX and BTT, and were not merely paid spokespersons.\u201d Many celebrities and athletes have used their influence and massive social media followings to promote cryptocurrencies in recent years, including Matt Damon, Tom Brady and Reese Witherspoon. But doing so without disclosing when they're being paid to do so is illegal, and has landed some big names in hot water with securities regulators. Last fall, Kim Kardashian agreed to pay a $1 million fine to settle federal charges that she recommended Ethereum Max tokens, a crypto security, to her millions Instagram followers without making clear that she was paid to do so. In 2020, actor Steven Seagal agreed to pay more than $300,000 as part of a similar settlement with the SEC, which also banned him from promoting investments for three years.

David Marcus sides with Coinbase David Marcus, former head of Meta\u2019s crypto projects, acknowledged Coinbase\u2019s engagement with regulators and its willingness to \u201cplay by the rules.\u201d He lamented that cooperative companies are treated more harshly by regulators than those that commit fraud, noting that the now-collapsed FTX exchange did not experience regulations so strict. Like Coinbase, Meta\u2019s own Diem cryptocurrency project was affected by overregulation. This was one factor that led Diem to shut down in January 2022. Other industry leaders comment Jake Chervinsky, Chief Policy Officer of the Blockchain Association, also acknowledged that Coinbase spent an \u201cextraordinary amount\u201d of resources working with the SEC. The Blockchain Association said it \u201cstands in support\u201d of Coinbase. Elsewhere, Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto research firm Messari, sent a letter to members of Congress asking for fair regulation for the crypto industry. Though his letter does not mention Coinbase directly, it was seemingly prompted by the Coinbase Wells notice as it was composed on the same day. It was later re-tweeted by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Justin Slaughter, Policy Director of the crypto-focused VC firm Paradigm, also commented on the situation. Slaughter previously held positions with the U.S. SEC and CFTC and suggested that some individuals in government are privately sympathetic to Coinbase. Though the SEC has not yet filed charges against Coinbase, the company intends to fight the SEC in court if charges are indeed filed. If and when that happens, other crypto companies and leaders will likely come to Coinbase\u2019s side.

Chris Lehane, SVP of Policy & Communications at Airbnb, kicked off the Twitter space by giving the \u2018forward-looking statement\u2019 disclaimer usually reserved for earnings calls and other official communications, giving the Space a sense of gravitas unfamiliar to the format. The Space started with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong referencing the Wells Notice, initially stating, \u201cwe didn\u2019t think this was unexpected, to be honest.\u201d He further framed Coinbase as keen to play by the rules saying, \u201cwe\u2019ve always taken a compliance first approach[\u2026] we want there to be a bridge between fiat and crypto.\u201d However, Armstrong revealed that \u201cthe SEC is one where we\u2019ve really struggled over the past few years.\u201d He then recounted that Coinbase had attempted to contact the SEC to discuss the regulatory landscape with no avail until the SEC specifically requested to visit Coinbase last year. Armstrong disclosed that Coinbase had \u201c30 meetings over the last nine months\u201d with the SEC, which was supposed to culminate in a meeting where feedback would be given. However, Armstrong alleged that the SEC canceled the meeting the day before it was supposed to happen and subsequently filed a Wells Notice to Coinbase a week later. The frustration in Armstrong\u2019s voice was evident as he further declared that \u201cwe\u2019ve been asking for them to file official rules\u201d and that Coinbase had attempted to acquire licenses preemptively to ensure compliance, but those licenses remain dormant. Additionally, concerning the SEC\u2019s recent change in approach to staking, Armstrong commented that the word staking was referenced over 50 times in the Coinbase S1 document meaning \u201cthe SEC allowed us to become a public company knowing all these details.\u201d In a bold statement, Armstrong then suggested that the U.S. is the furthest behind in terms of regulation for crypto and that while other countries are promoting crypto businesses, the U.S. is falling behind. Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Office for Coinbase, continued the conversation by expressing that his role in dealing with the SEC has been challenging given that \u201cwe\u2019ve simply been told nothing.\u201d The Space was arranged to address the Wells Notice while also explaining that Coinbase has repeatedly attempted to engage with regulators without success.

He has been a successful businessman, venture capitalist, economist and expert\u2026 The post Alex Reinhardt: The Power of Leverage in the Crypto Market appeared first on Business Times.",content:"Alex Reinhardt is one of the most influential people in the crypto industry today. He has been a successful businessman, venture capitalist, economist and expert in the field of crypto technologies and start-up development for many years. Alex has held numerous coaching seminars which have been attended by over half a million people and he is an authority on leveraging for successful crypto investments. In this article, we will explore Alex\u2019s advice on how to use leverage when trading cryptocurrencies, as well as discuss different types of leverage such as margin trading and futures contracts. We\u2019ll also look at the associated risks with using leverage to help you make informed decisions when investing in cryptocurrency markets. Leverage is a powerful tool that can be used to increase profits in the trading of cryptocurrencies. Alex Reinhardt has recommended leveraging as a way to maximize gains in the crypto market. Leverage is essentially a loan taken from a broker or exchange, which effectively allows traders to make bigger trades with less capital. By using leverage, traders can magnify their returns and potentially make larger profits than they could have without it. For example, when trading crypto with leverage, if the price of the asset moves in favour of the trader by just 1%, the trader will make an even higher return due to the borrowed funds used for buying that asset. This means that if traders use leverage correctly, they can exponentially increase their profits on small movements in the price of cryptocurrencies. However, it\u2019s important to note that while leveraging can provide significant potential profits, it also carries risks. Leveraged positions are typically more volatile and riskier than traditional investments since losses are amplified as well when prices move against you. Therefore, Alex Reinhardt suggests using leverage only after researching and understanding the associated risks involved and making sure you understand how it works before taking on any leveraged positions. There are several types of leverage available for crypto trading, such as margin trading and futures contracts. Margin trading allows traders to borrow funds from a broker or exchange and then use those funds to open positions with greater risk-reward ratios than regular trades would allow. Futures contracts are derivatives instruments which allow you to speculate on an asset\u2019s future price movements without actually owning it. Both these strategies involve borrowing money from an exchange or broker at an agreed interest rate for a specific period to increase your position size relative to your account balance. The different types of leverage available for cryptocurrency trading are margin trading and futures contracts. Margin trading allows traders to borrow funds from a broker or exchange and then use those funds to open positions with greater risk-reward ratios than regular trades would allow. Traders can also use margin trading to engage in leveraged short selling, which involves borrowing an asset and subsequently selling it to profit from its price decline. Futures contracts are derivatives instruments which allow traders to speculate on an asset\u2019s future price movements without actually owning it. These contracts specify the exact date, amount and quality of the underlying asset that has to be delivered at a certain point in the future. This gives traders the ability to take advantage of market movements without having to own the underlying asset itself. In addition, Alex Reinhardt recommends using options as another way to leverage investments in cryptocurrencies. Options are financial instruments that allow buyers to purchase an option for a premium payment that gives them the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date in the future. They provide investors with more flexibility than other forms of leverage because they give you more control over how much risk you want to take on at any given time. The use of leverage is risky in any investment, and the same is true for trading cryptocurrencies. Leveraged positions are more volatile and riskier than traditional investments as losses can be amplified if prices move against you. Additionally, when traders borrow funds to leverage their trades, they are taking on additional debt which must be repaid regardless of the outcome of their trades. If the market moves against them, they may end up with a much larger debt than they had anticipated and could potentially suffer significant financial losses. More details: Alex Reinhardt: The Secrets Of Making Money With Cryptos Another risk associated with leveraged trading is that traders often overestimate their knowledge and skills when taking on leveraged positions. Alex Reinhardt recommends doing extensive research before attempting leveraged trading so that traders understand the risks involved in this strategy. Additionally, since cryptocurrency markets are highly unpredictable and volatile, leveraging opens traders up to large losses more quickly than traditional investments due to higher levels of volatility and rapid price movements. Finally, it is important to note that brokers or exchanges offering leveraged products may also charge fees or set limits which can further limit profits or increase losses in certain cases. Before entering into any leveraged position it\u2019s important to read all the terms and conditions thoroughly so that you understand what fees may apply and what restrictions may exist. 1. Do extensive research on leverage trading before entering into any leveraged positions, so that you understand the risks associated with this strategy. 2. Set realistic expectations for profits and losses when taking on leveraged trades and be sure to keep a close eye on market movements at all times. 3. Be aware of the fees or limits that may be imposed by brokers or exchanges offering leveraged products as they can further limit profits or increase losses in certain cases. 4. Consider using stop-loss orders when engaging in leverage trading, which will help ensure that your trade is closed automatically if it reaches a predetermined price level to minimize potential losses should markets move against you. 5. Use appropriate risk management strategies such as diversifying holdings between different asset classes and setting reasonable position sizes relative to your overall investment capital so as not to expose too much of your portfolio to one particular asset class at any given time while still allowing you access to high returns from leverage trading opportunities when they arise. Alex Reinhardt\u2019s advice on leveraging for successful crypto investments is to do extensive research before entering into any leveraged positions, set realistic expectations about profits and losses, be aware of the fees and limits imposed by brokers or exchanges, consider using stop-loss orders, and use appropriate risk management strategies such as diversifying holdings between different asset classes and setting reasonable position sizes relative to overall investment capital.

Does it impact SEO for online searches when keywords are included in NFT domain-based websites? Let\u2019s find out!",content:"Search Engine Optimization (SEO) increases brand awareness, engagement, and interaction by creating organic traffic or natural search results and boosting your website's position utilizing tools such as keywords. NFT domains are blockchain-based human-friendly names replacing complex crypto addresses with computer-communicable alphanumeric characters. It is a smart contract-authenticated NFT for hosting websites, dApps, wallets, etc. Users can create individualized online identities and upload digital content by minting NFT domains on service providers such as Quik.com, ENS domains , and Unstoppable Domains . NFT domains are keyword-rich, with the potential of gaining a keyword-based TLD such as dot-metaverse for metaverse ventures and a keyword-rich name such as the universe, resulting in an ultra-rich keyword in the domain name such as universe-dot-metaverse. Today, only a few modern browsers support NFT domains and require a plugin or extension to access their features, which are not viewable on the standard web. Yet, Google does not appear to index NFT domains anytime soon because the IANA registry does not include these TLDs as domains. This is both a positive and a negative feature. If IANA accepts them as TLDs under its jurisdiction, the formerly decentralized feature will become centralized. However, from the standpoint of the traditional web, if it is not indexed as a domain, it is troublesome for SEO implications. If your content is not structured for Google or most search engines, readers will have difficulty finding it naturally. Nonetheless, certain search engines are naturally dedicated to NFT domains to host decentralized websites, but they are not yet fully adopted by all. However, the digital attributes of NFT domains are aimed at Web3. The internet has yet to fully embrace this new technological trend of minting web3 domains on Quik.com-enhanced blockchain technology, but when it does, you sure won't regret the fruitful value it will create. Individuals who buy NFT domains on Quik.com are already ahead of the game because they may get brandable premium names that may provide SEO benefits in the future. Since the adoption is rising alongside the technology and users and squatters acquiring top names, you might be left with very few in the future. However, let's look at how NFT domains might affect SEO and internet searches in the future. As previously said, NFT domains are keyword rich, with numerous TLDs accessible ranging from generic to specialized industries, explaining and educating the consumer about a website's content. Similarly to the preceding example, universe-dot-metaverse completely explains that this website is a metaverse universe-based experience. If you want anything with cryptocurrency, you could prefer one with a dot-doge or dot-btc reference. It is not required to keep to an industry-specific TLD and mint according to that, but those who want to obtain effective rankings in SEO should follow these rules. Imagine having a keyword-improved TLD with a keyword-enhanced 2LD within keyword-enhanced content. Wouldn't that rank you on top? As there is still time for technology to practice SEO and become a routine functioning online, you can learn about your NFT domain, purchase one, and practice the fundamental cores to help you advance and upgrade your SEO for web3 until it becomes mainstream. While a wide choice of genre-specific TLDs is available on Quik.com, gamers, business owners, businesses, freelancers, organizations, or anybody can build customized and enriched wallet addresses for their crypto endeavors and construct online identities or host websites. The government might use the dot-web3 web3 domain by Quik.com to construct its decentralized administration on web3, or corporations could use the dot-chain blockchain domain name by Quik.com to create a chain of employee subdomains and documents. Freelancers could obtain the dot-i domain individual names by Quik.com to signify a solitary internet operation. While web3 is progressing, and yet in its early stages, it will soon be accepted by mainstream media. Those who resist the trend will regret not adopting it because decentralized keywording will become more competitive; why? There will be no limits on Web3; users can host whatever they want and upload content to their hearts' content. Being first and hosting content today will allow you to reach a larger audience tomorrow than waiting for it to become mainstream and then uploading. Imagine leading with a keyword on the decentralized web when it becomes popular. That would almost probably give you a strong decentralized monopoly. But, NFT domains are still a new concept. Therefore if you want to build a decentralized website, let's first understand how to input SEO and its tools on NFT domains. Keywords are words or phrases used to search for a product on a search engine, displaying the results based on the most organic content. It is an essential component of SEO, or you might call it the backbone of SEO. Anyone hosting a decentralized website must grasp keywords and their utilization and also understand how to improve the feature by deliberately inserting important keywords in their website to rank well in the web area. Users utilize all of these keywords to find relevant information, and merely putting these keywords on your website does not check all of the boxes; you must also answer your target audience's question, which is where the following keyword research parameter comes into play. If you establish a decentralized website today, use these terms! Even if you intend to do so in the future, these terms will make it easier for you to rank higher. The objective of each search query is fundamentally the users and their search intent. The basic goal of search engines is to meet user end-meets and satisfy their search intent. These are the results that pertain to their search queries or keywords. For example, the phrase \" NFT domains \" will show all marketplaces offering NFT domains and blogs rich in NFT domain keywords. If your website meets the requirements of the user's intent, it will most likely rank first on SERP. It is one of the most crucial aspects of keyword research and SEO in general, which means you must supply all necessary information about the target keywords to your target audience for them to engage with your product. Keyword research tools include all relevant data, such as search traffic, keyword complexity, traffic, keyword intent, and competition SERP analysis. These tools can help you find keywords for your decentralized website employing NFT domains. Since the technology has not yet matured to a full-fledged description, it is not being indexed on Google, so you won't be able to explore it on the traditional web. But once it gets mainstream, you will surely benefit major if you start applying the techniques mentioned above from today! Act wisely like others and buy your NFT domain on Quik.com today before it gets too late, owing to its beneficial potential to shape the future.

Emmer serves as co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus alongside Soto. He said in the announcement: \u201cCrypto and blockchain technology, by nature, does not easily fit into the frameworks policymakers have considered when crafting regulations in the past. For too long, federal regulators and lawmakers have jammed the blockchain ecosystem into statutory definitions that just do not make sense.\u201d \u2018Safe Harbor\u2019 for non-controlling entities Under Emmer\u2019s bill, only entities that custody consumer funds should be considered money transmitters. According to Emmer: \u201cIt should be simple: If you don\u2019t custody consumer funds, you aren\u2019t a money transmitter. \u201c As such, miners, validators and crypto wallet software providers should not have to apply for licensing or be subject to regulatory requirements as they do not have direct custody of consumers\u2019 crypto. The bill proposes giving blockchain developers, miners, validators and non-custodial wallet software providers legal \u201csafe harbor\u201d from stringent regulations placed on entities that do control consumer funds, like exchanges. Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act Based on the Congressional record , the bill was first introduced in 2018. Its main aim is to establish that certain blockchain developers and certain blockchain service providers should be exempt from stringent licensing and regulatory reporting requirements that are placed on money transmitters. It previously failed to gain traction in the house in previous years due to the lack of interest following the 2017 market crash. However, political interest in the blockchain space has seen a massive resurgence since; and with the end of the bear market on the horizon, politicians and regulators are scrambling to establish rules.

This confirmed one forecast in particular: namely the forecast that the Bitcoin course was about to make a directional decision. The cryptocurrency has trended about 4 percent weaker over the past 24 hours of trading, marking the biggest bitcoin sell-off so far this year. An event that many investors could not count on. While this should hardly change anything in the strategy for professional investors, it is somewhat different for new investors: For new investors in the crypto market, are recommended for entry instead of investing larger amounts of money with whole Bitcoins. Brief overview of the latest developments How to proceed now? Forecasts are extremely difficult. Some talk of a clear oversell, which should level off again. On the other hand: Negative funding rates currently give the buyer camp a high incentive for a new entry into Bitcoin. A temporary price recovery is expected by many investors and the positive signs on the US stock market shortly after this Bitcoin crash underline this scenario. Overall, the situation for the Bitcoin course will remain uncertain in the coming weeks and months. Analysts see both positives and negatives that can affect price. Investors should therefore follow developments closely and adjust their investment decisions accordingly. Correction with a short shock? Despite the recent price correction and negative headlines, the fundamentals of the Bitcoin network remain stable. Network activity shows that the hash rate, which measures the total computing power on the proof-of-work network, continues to rise. The hash rate has almost doubled since November 2021, although the price has fallen significantly over the same period of time. The number of active addresses on the Bitcoin network has also increased despite the current market situation, indicating growing demand and usage. Fundamental data as the most important variable? The positive fundamental metrics of the bitcoin network could soon push the price higher again. Also, the negative impact of the Silvergate issues may be limited as the crypto bank is rather small and its impact on the overall market should be limited. The bitcoin options market has also calmed down somewhat, meaning there is less risk of panic selling or massive liquidations. In addition, there are other signs that Bitcoin could rise again soon. An important factor is the high demand for Bitcoin ETFs, which has been growing steadily since their launch in October 2021. Institutional investors are also showing increased interest in Bitcoin, which is reflected in the increasing volumes in the futures markets. How can Bitcoin investors behave in phases of unpredictable developments? Below are some approaches that investors can pursue in such phases. Diversification: Bitcoin investors should diversify their portfolio to protect against unpredictable developments in the cryptocurrency market. Diversification can be achieved by buying different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, as well as stocks and other asset classes. A stop-loss order can help minimize the risk of loss by automatically triggering the sale of bitcoins whenever the price falls below a certain value. However, a stop-loss order cannot guarantee that the sale will occur at the desired price \u2013 at least in the case of strong market movements or high volatility. Those who use technical analysis can also spot patterns and make decisions: Thorough technical analysis can help identify market sentiment and make informed decisions about buying and selling bitcoins. Key support and resistance levels are important. Overall, risk management is particularly appropriate: Bitcoin investors should have a clear understanding of how much risk they are willing to take and how much they are willing to lose. If investors adjust to events like Silvergate, FTX and similar \u201ccrises\u201d, these will not be able to change the long-term strategy and the successes of investors.",pubDate:"2023-03-23 18:24:34",image_url:null,source_id:"coinjournal",category:["top"],country:["united kingdom"],language:"english"},{title:"U.S SEC Issues Investors Alert Warning Over Cryptocurrency Dealings",link:"https://thenewscrypto.com/u-s-sec-issues-investors-alert-warning-over-cryptocurrency-dealings/",keywords:["Bitcoin News","Tradingview","Bitcoin","SEC"],creator:["Ashfaq"],video_url:null,description:"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a warning to investors about cryptocurrency investments.

New LUNC Proposal Wants To Burn 3.4% Of Supply A new LUNC proposal has come with an unexpected twist. Where most other proposals in the community so far have asked that there should be some kind of burn tax imposed on transactions, Proposal 11398 wants the community to burn the Oracle Pool.

Will Such A Burn Help The LUNA Classic Price? Removing such a good percentage of the supply from circulation would no doubt have a positive impact on the price of the digital asset. In fact, if the community pool were to be burned, it would account for over 500% more tokens burned than what has been collectively burned since the LUNC burn started around a year ago.

At best, it gets 1 million tokens deposited to take it to the governance stage but it would quickly be vetoed and voted No because of the importance of the Oracle Pool. As for LUNC\u2019s price, it is still trending around the $0.000125 level, down 1.86% in the last day.

The post SEC issues investor alert over crypto investments appeared first on CryptoSlate.",content:"Share Tweet Post Share Post Email Ad The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 23 issued a notice highlighting several reasons investors should be wary of investing in crypto assets securities. \u201cInvestments in crypto asset securities can be exceptionally volatile and speculative, and the platforms where investors buy, sell, borrow, or lend these securities may lack important protections for investors.\u201d The SEC said firms offering crypto investments services might violate several applicable laws, including the federal securities laws. The regulator added that the law requires anyone offering securities to register with the Commission to enable proper regulation and oversight of the industry. The bulletin mentioned that crypto exchanges\u2019 proof of reserves is not a standard audited financial statement. According to the regulator, investors should exercise extreme caution when relying on such statements to make decisions. The SEC further warned that crypto assets could be exceptionally risky and often volatile. The commission said they are subject to significant risks ranging from enforcement of regulations that may prevent their use to the bankruptcy of the company holding the assets. The regulator also noted that scammers use crypto assets\u2019 popularity to defraud retail investors. It mentioned Ponzi, pyramid schemes, and rug pulls as some of the ways these bad actors perpetrate fraudulent acts. The SEC wrote: \u201cIt is never a good idea to make an investment decision just because someone famous says a product or service is a good investment.\u201d Meanwhile, the SEC gave some investment tips which can help ensure investing success. The language and timing of the publication raise eyebrows as the regulator has increased its scrutiny of the industry. On March 22, the SEC filed charges against crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun and issued a wells notice to U.S.-based exchange Coinbase. Besides that, the bulletin is coming a few days after the White House Council of Economic Advisers published a report that heavily criticized cryptocurrencies , saying that most don\u2019t have a fundamental value. \u201cThey continue to cause risks for financial markets, investors and investors and consumers,\u201d the report added.

Rafique\u2019s five proposed developments [\u2026]",content:"Haider Rafique, the chief marketing officer at OKX, has caused a stir in the Bitcoin (BTC) community by inviting the public to on his five proposed possible future developments for the cryptocurrency. However, the still ongoing vote has attracted significant attention, with 18.8K views on the post at the time of writing. Rafique\u2019s five proposed developments are ambitious, to say the least. He has predicted that five years into the future, BTC price ATH will reach $500k+, there will be over 2 billion Bitcoin wallets in existence, and hundreds of publicly traded companies will hold BTC in their treasury. Additionally, the BTC market cap will surpass that of top precious metals, and BTC will become the reserve currency for more than 50 nations. Incredibly, the majority of voters so far have seen these developments as possible. According to Rafique\u2019s tweet, 57.1% of voters believe the developments are reasonable, while 42.9% see them as absurd. This result is surprising, given the magnitude of Rafique\u2019s predictions. The tweet has also attracted comments from well-known figures in the Bitcoin community, like Jason Lau, COO at Okcoin, who joked with Rafique, asking, \u201cWhy so bearish?\u201d Meanwhile, one community member expressed skepticism about BTC becoming a reserve currency, highlighting concerns about the security of the blockchain. Despite the doubt of some community members, Rafique\u2019s tweet shows the ambitious outlook many Bitcoin enthusiasts have for the future of crypto. Only time will tell whether Rafique\u2019s predictions will come true. But for now, it seems most voters believe anything is possible. Bitcoin enthusiasts are feeling optimistic as the digital currency has rallied nearly 70% so far this year. Industry insiders remain bullish, with some predicting new heights for the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency. Marshall Beard, chief strategy officer at U.S.-headquartered crypto exchange Gemini, said $100,000 could be a possibility for BTC. Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at stablecoin issuer Tether, said Bitcoin could \u201cretest\u201d its all-time high near $69,000. Bitcoin\u2019s positive outlook stems from how the asset has performed during the recent banking turmoil sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the failure of two crypto-friendly lenders, Silvergate Capital, and Signature Bank. Instead of crashing, Bitcoin rallied. Many believe this is evidence that Bitcoin is offering an alternative to the traditional banking system as a place for people to keep their money safe. However, according to current price analysis, CoinMarketcap\u2019s shows that BTC is trading at , with a 10% increase in the weekly chart.

Share this article URL Copied Terra frontman Do Kwon was apprehended at Podgorica airport by Montenegrin police. He was previously believed to be hiding in Serbia. Six Months on the Run The law has finally caught up to Do Kwon. Montenegro Minister of the Interior Filip Adzic tweeted today that Montenegrin police had apprehended a person suspected of being Terra frontman Do Kwon. Adzic claimed that Kwon was detained at Podgorica airport with \u201cfalsified documents\u201d\u2014 potentially meaning forged travel documents, as Kwon\u2019s passport was revoked by South Korean authorities in September 2022. It\u2019s unclear whether he was attempting to enter or leave Montenegro. Podgorica is the nation\u2019s capital city. Adzic indicated that he was awaiting an official confirmation of Kwon\u2019s identity. South Korean news network Yonhap reported that South Korea\u2019s National Police Agency had already \u201cchecked the age, nationality, and name with the identification card\u201d of the man arrested by Montenegrin police, and had confirmed his identity via photographic data. They are still awaiting fingerprint information from Montenegrin authorities. Kwon is the CEO of Terraform Labs, which designed the Terra blockchain. Terra imploded in May 2022 when the network\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, lost its peg and entered a death spiral, wiping out more than $40 billion from the markets. Refusing to cooperate with criminal investigations, Kwon fled from South Korea to Singapore shortly after Terra\u2019s collapse. Interpol issued a red notice for him in September, making him a wanted man in 195 countries. Despite the news, Kwon insisted that he was not \u201con the run\u201d and kept an active presence on Twitter. South Korean authorities claimed in December that Kwon was hiding in Serbia. Kwon was reportedly traveling with an aide named Han at the time of his arrest. According to DL News , Serbian police were on Kwon\u2019s trail and had already begun a pre-extradition process. He may therefore have been attempting to flee Serbian authorities by entering Montenegro. Disclosure: At the time of writing, the author of this piece owned BTC, ETH, and several other crypto assets.

More and more exciting GameFi projects are joining the space as the traditional gaming industry looks destined to change forever. The best GameFi projects deliver integrated financial rewards to players across various genres. For anyone looking to invest in blockchain gaming for the long term, here are 12 of the very best projects that the sector has to offer: 1. Metacade (MCADE) will contain the broadest selection of blockchain gaming experiences in Web3, as the new GameFi project will be home to many different play-to-earn games. Unlike traditional online games, Metacade allows anyone to earn in-game rewards while having fun and competing online. There is a wide variety of titles available in this metaverse arcade, combining casual and competitive gameplay. This is a truly comprehensive GameFi experience. By offering advanced incentive structures and displaying the latest trends in blockchain gaming, the project aims to become a central hub for Web3 users. Metacade\u2019s Create2Earn feature will reward content creators with MCADE tokens for their contributions to the community. This can include posting game reviews, sharing alpha and in game assets, and interacting with other members\u2019 posts. As well as this, Metacade will advertise open positions at some of Web3\u2019s hottest start-ups. This allows crypto enthusiasts to kickstart a career in Web3, as Metacade\u2019s Work2Earn feature is designed to expand the blockchain workforce, which can help to boost the overall level of innovation in the sector over time. Metacade\u2019s Metagrants program is also specially designed to help drive GameFi forwards. The community can vote to decide which new blockchain games are best before the project provides funding to the development team. This helps to ensure that the best GameFi projects can develop and reach the market. The MCADE token has just launched during a presale event. The MCADE presale has been a huge success so far, as the project has raised $12.9m in 17 weeks since the beginning of the event. MCADE\u2019s presale success is a testament to its attractive offering, since blockchain gamers worldwide can access a broad platform that offers generous cryptocurrency rewards. Web3 games typically offer only one gameplay option, but Metacade offers many. For now, the price of MCADE is just $0.02 and it\u2019s in the final stage of the presale before listing on exchanges. Experts are forecasting significant gains for the new token, as its unique offering within Web3 could lead to it becoming one of the best GameFi projects in the space. 2. STEPN (GMT) STEPN is an innovative move-to-earn ecosystem that allows consumers to earn rewards for completing steps on the StepN platform. StepN\u2019s innovative reward system does not require any monetary contribution from its users and requires only a few seconds of effort to complete each step. STEPN\u2019s revolutionary incentive model generated significant interest when the STEPN token was first launched in 2022. The platform benefits its users with real-time financial rewards for something they do every day. Using STEPN, users can move faster and travel less than with traditional systems, allowing them to maximize their profits with minimal effort. StepN is quickly becoming the industry leader, altering blockchain gaming\u2019s to incorporate new social use cases. GMT is just one year old, yet it has already made a significant footprint in Web3. The STEPN platform is a unique and innovative modification of popular blockchain game mechanics, which could lead to it becoming one of the best GameFi projects in the crypto space. After reaching its all-time high at $4 during the crypto winter of 2022, STEPN is now valued at just $0.40. Experts forecast over 10x gains for the new token as it reclaims its previous high and enters price discovery over the coming years. 3. Illuvium (ILV) Illuvium, or ILV, is a blockchain game built on the Ethereum platform. It is a fantasy world set in a vast open-world metaverse that allows players to freely explore the impressive virtual landscape. Illuvium combines photorealistic graphics with an in-depth plotline to keep players engaged, making it one of the most sought-after GameFi games around. Players can collect rare creatures called Illuvials, as well as battle and trade them in the Illuvial arena to earn cryptocurrency rewards. By forming guilds and collaborative alliances, players can play directly with other blockchain gamers, which adds a cooperative element to the game. Illuvium also allows players to trade collectible items as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), such as IlluviCrafts and IlluviShares. The addition of blockchain technology ensures that all gameplay is transparent and secure \u2013 allowing players to for their victories that have innate financial value. Illuvium has been described as a true AAA game on the blockchain thanks to its advanced graphics and vast open-world map. Fantasy gamers can enjoy a massive open world filled with new experiences while gaining the benefits of blockchain through player ownership over in game items and digital currency rewards. As one of the best GameFi projects to be released in recent years, the progress made by the Illuvium team has been rapid. The ILV token climbed to an all-time high of almost $2000 during the 2021 bull market and now finds itself below $100. This could be a great entry point for one of the most promising GameFi tokens in 2023. With just 2.2 million ILV tokens in circulation, it is one of the most scarce GameFi cryptos in Web3. As demand for Illuvium grows, investors can be confident that ILV, the in game currency, will reclaim much of its previous value as it aims to breach the $1000 mark. 4. ApeCoin (APE) ApeCoin (APE) is a newly-released token that represents the APE Foundation. While not strictly a GameFi project, ApeCoin aims to usher in a new era for the internet by encouraging the development of metaverse-based communities. This has led to the APE Foundation backing several top game finance projects, including Otherside. Otherside is a major open-world metaverse widely considered one of the best GameFi projects currently being developed. The game is a virtual reality world filled with exciting quests and stunning scenery, allowing players to earn cryptocurrency rewards for their game progress. APE Foundation, inspired by Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection, is the decentralized autonomous organization ( ) that helps govern the development of Otherside and other projects within the APE Ecosystem. This gives it an important role in driving progress for GameFi companies in Web3. APE is one of the most popular governance tokens in Web3. All holders gain voting rights in the ApeCoin DAO, which determines how the APE Foundation acts. Given the team\u2019s previous successes behind the project, this is a strong use case for a cryptocurrency token. APE is expected to rise significantly in value before the release of Otherside, a hotly anticipated GameFi project. The contributions made by the APE Foundation could revolutionize the traditional gaming industry over time, as the blockchain gaming ecosystem looks set to grow thanks to the ability to earn in-game assets while exploring virtual worlds. For now, the APE token is valued at $5. Since the token launched in 2022, it has major potential for future returns as it has yet to fully enter price discovery during a crypto bull market. As a result, the APE token could be a great option for anyone looking to invest in the future of metaverse-based gaming. 5. Decentraland (MANA) Decentraland (MANA) is a virtual world on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to create, experience, and monetize content and applications within a virtual environment. This unique offering is a key reason why Decentraland has become one of the leading GameFi projects in Web3, as anyone can build fully-customizable creations on top of purchased land. Decentraland leverages gaming NFTs to provide ownership rights over in-game assets, including land parcels and other ownable items such as buildings, artwork, clothing, and accessories created by Decentraland\u2019s users. MANA is the native token for Decentraland, which can be used for transactions within the universe or converted into assets. Unlike traditional video games, Decentraland allows anyone to buy, sell, and trade entire map sections. This gives players more world-building power than ever before. MANA is one of the top GameFi projects due to its unique offering, which could expand to include additional services over time. The Decentraland platform has many different GameFi projects and custom experiences, including Las Vegas-style gambling and play-to-earn assault courses. Decentraland has the potential to grow over time as the browser-based platform is completely driven by its users. Anyone can purchase land in Decentraland using MANA tokens, which gives MANA innate utility and the ability to experience constantly increasing demand. For now, MANA is priced at $0.60 after falling 90% from its all-time high. It faces strong resistance as it tries to reclaim this previous price level, but many experts suggest it will form new highs over time. This makes it one of the best GameFi cryptos to buy right now. 6. Axie Infinity (AXS) Axie Infinity (AXS) is a blockchain-based collectible game where players can purchase, breed, and battle fantasy creatures called Axies in a virtual environment. Axies have unique traits that can be unlocked by performing various tasks and challenges. As gamers play Axie Infinity, they can maximize their Axies\u2019 power level by collecting and trading additional NFTs. This can give players an edge in battle and help them to earn in game rewards in the form of AXS tokens. AXS, as well as being used to reward gamers for their progress, serves as the main currency for transactions inside the Axie Infinity marketplace. AXS makes it easier for users to collect and trade rare Axies as they seek to build the best collection capable of beating all the competition. Axie Infinity became the most widely-used GameFi platform in Web3 during the 2021 bull run. It began to attract almost 2 million daily active users, which is a testament to it being one of the best GameFi projects in terms of how addictive it is to play. However, the AXS price has recently suffered after the Ronin Bridge \u2013 a unique GameFi protocol built specifically to support the game \u2013 was hacked. It was the largest hack in the history of Web3, as over $600 million of user funds were lost. After being worth $160 per token, AXS is now just $10. The Axie Infinity team has already improved the security protocol for the platform, and the game continues to attract a significant player base. Many investors have suggested that AXS will recover over time, making the $10 price level a great long-term entry point. 7. Yield Guild Games (YGG) Yield Guild Games (YGG) supports blockchain-based games by focusing on bringing together players and crypto-economics. As a DAO, the project\u2019s core aim is to collect in-game NFTs with a view to optimizing them for in-game economies and making a profit for shareholders. YGG purchases in-game assets, whether virtual land parcels, rare collectible items, and much more.

As the translation of the tweet from Japanese reads, the campaign will start on March 22 and end the moment it starts handling SHIB. Earlier this year, on Feb. 28, OkCoinJapan, the Japanese subsidiary of San Francisco-based exchange OkCoin, listed the Shiba Inu token. XRP options now available on major exchange after price moves further According to a recent announcement by leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance , it expanded its line of XRP-focused investment products. As stated on the exchange\u2019s website, all its users will have access to weekly options contracts for XRP/USDT. Apart from XRP, such a product is only available for BTC, ETH and BNB.

It is interesting to note that new XRP investment options were made available on Binance the day after the token demonstrated the best price action among major crypto assets: on March 21, XRP spiked more than 30%, hitting its four-month high of $0.493. Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate up enormous 4,600%, what's happening? Per recent on-chain data, Shiba Inu saw a significant increase in its burn rate, which surged to almost 5,000%. Yet it seems like such impressive growth has no effect on the asset\u2019s price as it did not show any notable change for the past two weeks. Theoretically, the sharp rise of Shiba Inu's burn rate should lead to a rise of the token\u2019s price due to the diminishing supply. However, the price has remained relatively stable, baffling investors. While analyzing Shiba Inu\u2019s price movement, it is also important to consider the influence of so-called whales. With SHIB's stagnant price despite the increased burn rate, it is possible that these large investors are cautiously watching market conditions, waiting for a strong indication of the token's future course before making their next move.

Justin Sun, according to the SEC chair Gensler, conducted illegal sales of TRX and BTT tokens, distributing them to investors and at the same time creating secondary markets for these cryptocurrencies through Tron Foundation and BitTorrent. Those secondary markets were allegedly heavily manipulated by Sun using wash trading. The SEC claims that Sun and his team created a targeted campaign to promote TRX and BTT.

What Is ELON Coin? Dogelon Mars is one of many DOGE-themed crypto tokens that launched in 2021. The team behind the crypto describes it as a fair universal currency for the people, it gained popularity after Elon Musk\u2019s tweets and looked to play off of Dogecoin\u2019s success and Elon Musk\u2019s vision to colonize Mars. In short, Dogelon Mars is a cryptocurrency that isn\u2019t meant for technical enthusiasts. Besides being a cryptocurrency, Dogelon Mars is also a character that stars in a comic series for sale as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These NFTs can be bought on OpenSea or Crypto.com . Dogelon Mars Features Dogelon Mars launched on April 23, 2021. There\u2019s no information available about the founder of the token, and there\u2019s little information that can be found online about the project itself. It also doesn\u2019t have a white paper detailing its purpose or goals, however, it does have a website and a Twitter account. In terms of utility, there\u2019s nothing that separates Dogelon Mars from other crypto tokens. Dogelon Mars is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain. Most holders simply save it in a blockchain wallet, and some will donate tokens to victims of crypto scams to help fulfill the community\u2019s mission. The team has announced plans to expand Dogelon Mars. ELON Tokenomics The starting supply for the project was 1 quadrillion ELON tokens. The developers sent half of those crypto tokens to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, copying a publicity stunt that was first done by Shiba Inu. Buterin donated about 43% of the ELON tokens to the Methuselah Foundation, a charity focused on extending human longevity. The foundation pledged in May 2021 not to sell any of those tokens for at least one year and to advance ELON\u2019s long-term value. The most important partnership Dogelon Mars has entered into was also with the Methuselah Foundation. The foundation has chosen to embrace the Dogelon Mars community. It published a paper, called the Amicus Token Paper, to go over its plans for the cryptocurrency. It even created its own character, Methuselon Mars, in the same style as the Dogelon Mars comics. Developers deposited the other half in a liquidity pool on Uniswap. They also deposited 40 ETH in the liquidity pool, worth about $100,000 at the time. They then burned the liquidity provider tokens they received so that they could neither retract the tokens nor collect any of Uniswap\u2019s liquidity rewards, which will just accrue over time. By burning the liquidity provider tokens, the Dogelon Mars team demonstrated that they weren\u2019t going to commit a rug pull, where developers pump up the value of their cryptocurrency, withdraw as much as they can, and abandon the project. The Dogelon Mars founders can\u2019t do that because when they deposited their funds into the project, they burned the tokens they received for doing so. So, all in all, Dogelon Mars wants to be honest with its fans and investors. Is Dogelon Mars a Good Investment? The problem with Dogelon Mars is that it\u2019s virtually indistinguishable from every other meme token. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies out there that work exactly like this one. However, as we all know, Dogecoin was once a joke coin, but its price skyrocketed, and a lot of people were happy about their seemingly worthless investment in DOGE. In addition, the Dogelon project seems to be developing: for instance, just recently, Rage Fan collaborated with Dogelon to introduce blockchain gaming for ELON holders. Just like with any other coin, its success in the future depends on a variety of factors that can change rapidly, so it\u2019s eventually up to the investor to decide whether Dogelon Mars is a risky investment or not.

LTC price rallied 5.5% to reach an intraday high of around $92.50. In comparison, the total crypto market capitalization (TOTAL) has risen 2.25% to $1.14 trillion, with BTC and ETH rising 1.79% and 1.42%, respectively. The Federal Reserve\'s 25 basis points (bps) rate hike on March 22 appears to be the key driver behind Litecoin beating its crypto rivals over the past 24 hours. Notably, LTC price rallied over 15% versus BTC and about 14.5% versus ETH since the Fed announcement. One reason could be that Litecoin has relatively underperformed the cryptocurrency market in March, dropping over 6.5% month-to-date (MTD) versus the crypto market\'s 9.35% gains. Hence, traders likely saw this as a "buy the dip" opportunity for Litecoin with more upside potential, particularly as there were little to no other notable catalysts. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows a rise in the Litecoin supply held by addresses with a balance between 1 million and 10 million LTC in March. Additionally, the share of supply held by addresses with a balance between 100,000 LTC and 1 million LTC has been dropping. This suggests that the whales holding 10,000-1 million LTC have been accumulating Litecoin in March to enter the 1 million-10 million LTC holders\' cohort. A halving event occurs when the rewards for mining new blocks get cut in half. Previous halvings in Bitcoin and Litecoin markets have preceded extended bull runs . Therefore, the next Litecoin halving, scheduled for August 2023, could also produce a similar bullish outcome. Independent market analyst Rekt Capital noted that the euphoria around the Litecoin halving may have influenced traders to buy LTC in the face of a "market-wide dip." $LTC is showing strength meanwhile most of the market struggles on this market-wide dip Important not to forget about the #LTC Halving this coming August 2023 #BTC #Crypto #LITECOIN https://t.co/otWMSUAYV9 From a technical perspective, Litecoin looks ready to undergo a price correction in the coming weeks. Related: Ethereum faces 6-month lows versus Bitcoin \u2014 Will ETH price rebound? Notably, LTC/USD is testing its multi-month descending trendline resistance for a potential pullback, similar to what transpired in May and November 2021. A decisive bearish reversal could have LTC test its previous support line near $47.50 as the downside target, down about 45% from current price levels. Conversely, a breakout above the descending trendline resistance may push LTC price toward the $105-140 price range. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
